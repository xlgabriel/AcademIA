# AcademIA
<h2>Description</h2>
I worked as Scrum Master in a LMS-type open-source collaborative project where the user (teacher, student) can access their academic courses, upload and review multimedia content for educational purposes. It also has Hangouts-style chat, with a plus of AI-type virtual assistant.

I invite you to check out the files located in this repository, they contain multiple documents related to my Scrum Master's role.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The project called AcademIA arose as a university proposal in a subject called Audiovisual Multimedia Systems. At first, my partners and I chose roles. There was from Product Owner, UX/UI to back-end and Infrastructure. I was the only one who took the role of Scrum Master, because I wanted to experience firsthand the dynamics of managing a project.

The project was divided into two systems: LMS and Chat. My area of ​​work focused on the Chat system, with two subsystems: AI and Messaging.
I personally find satisfaction in creating something from scratch, especially when it means optimizing the workflow of other professionals. The role fit perfectly with this notion, so even with little experience in this field, I spent quite a bit of time to live up to such an important role.

<h2>Getting started as a Scrum Master</h2>
Many things had to be defined immediately, but the first thing was the means of communication. First of all, as a team we agreed to use WhatsApp groups to expedite and communicate directly (at the university level, it is common to do this). In addition to this, I defined the use of Discord as fundamental for everything related to meetings, handling of audiovisual elements, communications, information and others. Slack was a similar option, but due to the habit of the other colleagues, I chose Discord as the best option. Next, the composition of the channel is displayed.

You can see a distribution by roles in the names of each user, in the same way they are also created and configured internally. Each person has their own channel and shared channels by role, which certainly made communication between the same role and different roles easier. There are channels for files, messages, memes and information. There are several voice channels, even the professor (Software Architect) was on the Discord and used it to communicate.
