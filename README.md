# AcademIA
<h2>Description</h2>
I worked as Scrum Master in a LMS-type open-source collaborative project where the user (teacher, student) can access their academic courses, upload and review multimedia content for educational purposes. It also has Hangouts-style chat, with a plus of AI-type virtual assistant.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The project called AcademIA arose as a university proposal in a subject called Audiovisual Multimedia Systems. At first, my partners and I chose roles. There was from Product Owner, UX/UI to back-end and Infrastructure. I was the only one who took the role of Scrum Master, because I wanted to experience firsthand the dynamics of managing a project.<br /><br />
I personally find satisfaction in creating something from scratch, especially when it means optimizing the workflow of other professionals. The role fit perfectly with this notion, so even with little experience in this field, I spent quite a bit of time to live up to such an important role.
