# AcademIA
<h2>Description</h2>
I worked as Scrum Master in a LMS-type open-source collaborative project where the user (teacher, student) can access their academic courses, upload and review multimedia content for educational purposes. It also has Hangouts-style chat, with a plus of AI-type virtual assistant.
